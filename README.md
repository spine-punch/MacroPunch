A custom enclosure to be used as a 3x3 macropad.

Dimensions based on the Raspberry Pico. (I have not tested pico knockoffs so i wouldnt recommend trying to make it work with one)

All screwholes are M2 screw standard.
Any lenght between 3 - 6 mm should work, though this depends slightly on manufacturing tolerances.
